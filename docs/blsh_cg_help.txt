                                 outliers_table annotations

Takes an annotation table and outlier count table (output of outliers_table)
and outputs qvalues from a statistical test that looks for enrichment of
outlier values in each group in the annotation table. For each value in each
comparison, the qvalue table will have 1 column, if there are any genes in
that comparison.

positional arguments:
  outliers_table        Table of outlier counts (output of outliers_table).
                        Must be .tsv or .csv file, with outlier and non-
                        outlier counts as columns, and genes/sites as rows.
  annotations           Table of annotations. Must be .csv or .tsv. Samples as
                        rows and comparisons as columns. Comparisons must have
                        only unique values (not including missing values). If
                        there are more options than that, you can use binarize
                        to prepare the table.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --output_prefix OUTPUT_PREFIX
                        Output prefix for writing files. Default outliers.
  --frac_filter FRAC_FILTER
                        The minimum fraction of samples per group that must
                        have an outlier in a gene toconsider that gene in the
                        analysis. This is used to prevent a high number of
                        outlier values in 1 sample from driving a low qvalue.
                        Default 0.3
  --write_comparison_summaries
                        Use flag to write a separate file for each column in
                        the annotations table, with outlier counts in each
                        group, p-values and q-values in each group.
  --iqrs IQRS           Number of IQRs used to define outliers in the input
                        count table. Optional.
  --up_or_down {up,down}
                        Whether input outlier table represents up or down
                        outliers. Needed for output file labels. Default up
  --write_gene_list     Use flag to write a list of significantly enriched
                        genes for each value in each comparison. If used, need
                        an fdr threshold as well.
  --make_heatmaps       Use flag to draw a heatmap of signficantly enriched
                        genes for each value in each comparison. If used, need
                        an fdr threshold as well.
  --fdr FDR             FDR cut off to use for signficantly enriched gene
                        lists and heatmaps. Default 0.05
  --red_or_blue {red,blue}
                        If --make_heatmaps is called, color of values to draw
                        on heatmap. Default red.
  --annotation_colors ANNOTATION_COLORS
                        File with color map to use for annotation header if
                        --make_heatmaps is used. Must have a 'value color'
                        format for each value in annotations. Any value not
                        represented will be assigned a new color.
