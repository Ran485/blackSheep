                           values annotations

Runs whole outliers pipeline. Has options to output every possible output.

positional arguments:
  values                File path to input values. Samples are columns and
                        genes/sites are rows. Only .tsv and .csv accepted.
  annotations           File path to annotation values. Rows are sample names,
                        header is different annotations. e.g. mutation status.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --output_prefix OUTPUT_PREFIX
                        Output prefix for writing files. Default outliers.
  --iqrs IQRS           Number of inter-quartile ranges (IQRs) above or below
                        the median to consider a value an outlier. Default is
                        1.5.
  --up_or_down {up,down}
                        Whether to look for up or down outliers. Choices are
                        up or down. Default up.
  --do_not_aggregate    Use flag if you do not want to sum outliers based on
                        site prefixes.
  --write_outlier_table
                        Use flag to write a table of outlier counts.
  --write_frac_table    Use flag if you want to write a table with fraction of
                        values per site per sample that are outliers. Useful
                        for custom visualization.
  --ind_sep IND_SEP     If site labels have a parent molecule (e.g. a gene
                        name such as ATM) and a site identifier (e.g. S365)
                        this is the delimiter between the two elements.
                        Default is -
  --frac_filter FRAC_FILTER
                        The minimum fraction of samples per group that must
                        have an outlier in a gene toconsider that gene in the
                        analysis. This is used to prevent a high number of
                        outlier values in 1 sample from driving a low qvalue.
                        Default 0.3
  --write_comparison_summaries
                        Use flag to write a separate file for each column in
                        the annotations table, with outlier counts in each
                        group, p-values and q-values in each group.
  --fdr FDR             FDR threshold to use to select genes to visualize.
                        Default 0.05
  --write_gene_list     Use flag to write a list of significantly enriched
                        genes for each value in each comparison.
  --make_heatmaps       Use flag to draw a heatmap of significantly enriched
                        genes for each value in each comparison. If used, need
                        an fdr threshold as well.
  --red_or_blue {red,blue}
                        Color of values to draw on heatmap. Default red.
  --annotation_colors ANNOTATION_COLORS
                        File with color map to use for annotation header. Must
                        have a line with 'value color' format for each value
                        in annotations. Any value not represented will be
                        assigned a new color.
